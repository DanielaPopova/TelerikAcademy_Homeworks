What do namespaces represent in an XML document? What are they used for?

Namespaces in XML are used to prevent name conflicts between different elements. There could be a default namespace
with the syntax - xmlns="default namespace", which is valid for all child elements, or using a prefix - xmlns:ns="some namespace".
Namespaces with prefix are NOT associated with the child elements of the element with that namespace, for example
<students:student xmlns:students="urn:students">
	<name>Pesho</name>
	<age>18</age>
</students:student>
Here "name" and "age" don't belong to "students" namespace. Same example with default namespace:
<student xmlns="urn:students">
	<name>Pesho</name>
	<age>18</age>
</student>
"name" and "age" belong to the default namespace
